# The Present Perfect Tense

**Level: B1-B2**  
**Grammar Focus: Present Perfect**

## Formation

### Structure

**Subject + have/has + past participle**

- I/You/We/They + **have** + past participle
- He/She/It + **has** + past participle

### Examples

- I **have worked** in IT for five years.
- She **has developed** three applications this month.
- They **have deployed** the new feature to production.

## Uses

### 1. Past Actions with Present Relevance

Use the present perfect when a past action has consequences or relevance in the present.

- **The team has fixed the bug.** (It's fixed now)
- **We have implemented CI/CD.** (The system is in place now)
- **I have reviewed your code.** (I know what it contains now)

### 2. Life Experiences

Use for experiences without specifying when they occurred.

- **Have you ever worked with Angular?**
- **She has never deployed to AWS.**
- **I have attended several DevOps conferences.**

### 3. Unfinished Time Periods

Use with time expressions like *today*, *this week*, *this month*, *this year*.

- **I have attended three meetings today.** (Today isn't finished)
- **We have released two versions this month.**
- **The system has crashed twice this week.**

### 4. Duration up to Now

Use with *for* and *since* to show duration.

- **I have been a developer for ten years.** (duration)
- **She has worked here since 2020.** (starting point)
- **We have used Kubernetes since the project started.**

## Common Time Markers

- **just**: I have **just** finished the code review.
- **already**: They have **already** deployed the fix.
- **yet** (questions/negatives): Have you tested it **yet**? / I haven't tested it **yet**.
- **recently**: We have **recently** migrated to the cloud.
- **lately**: I have been busy **lately**.
- **so far**: We have found three bugs **so far**.

## Present Perfect vs. Simple Past

### Present Perfect (connection to now)

- **I have deployed five applications.** (focus on experience/result)
- **The server has been down.** (current state unknown or still down)
- **Have you read the documentation?** (Do you know the content now?)

### Simple Past (finished time)

- **I deployed the application yesterday.** (specific time)
- **The server was down for two hours.** (specific completed period)
- **Did you read the documentation last week?** (specific past time)

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Incorrect

- I have worked there **in 2020**. (specific date → use Simple Past)
- She **has written** the code **yesterday**. (specific time → use Simple Past)
- We have deployed three times **last week**. (finished period → use Simple Past)

### ✅ Correct

- I **worked** there **in 2020**.
- She **wrote** the code **yesterday**.
- We **deployed** three times **last week**.
- I **have worked** in tech **since 2020**.
- She **has written** two modules **this week**.

## Technical Context Examples

### Software Development

- "I **have implemented** the authentication feature."
- "The code **has passed** all unit tests."
- "We **have not encountered** any memory leaks yet."

### DevOps

- "The pipeline **has failed** three times today."
- "I **have configured** the Kubernetes cluster."
- "Have you **set up** the monitoring tools?"

### Project Management

- "The team **has completed** the sprint successfully."
- "We **have achieved** all our targets this quarter."
- "The client **has approved** the latest prototype."

## Practice

Transform these Simple Past sentences to Present Perfect (when appropriate):

1. I learned Python in university. → ________________
2. She fixed the bug. → ________________
3. They deployed the application last Monday. → ________________
4. We worked on this project for three months. (still working) → ________________

**Answers:**
1. I have learned Python. (if experience matters, not when)
2. She has fixed the bug. (if bug is fixed now)
3. They deployed the application last Monday. (keep Simple Past - specific time)
4. We have worked on this project for three months. (duration continuing)

---

**Key Points:**
- Present Perfect connects past and present
- Don't use with specific past time expressions
- Use for experiences, recent events, and ongoing situations
- Common in professional/technical discussions about accomplishments
