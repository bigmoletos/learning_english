# The Passive Voice

**Level: B2-C1**  
**Grammar Focus: Passive Constructions**

## Formation

### Structure

**Subject + be (conjugated) + past participle (+ by + agent)**

- Present: The code **is written** in Python.
- Past: The bug **was fixed** yesterday.
- Present Perfect: The app **has been deployed**.
- Future: The system **will be updated** next week.
- Modal: The data **should be encrypted**.

## When to Use Passive Voice

### 1. Unknown or Unimportant Agent

When we don't know or don't care who performed the action:

- **The server was hacked last night.** (We don't know who)
- **The database is updated every hour.** (Automatic process)
- **New vulnerabilities have been discovered.** (By various researchers)

### 2. Focus on Action/Result

When the action or result is more important than the doer:

- **The application was released in 2023.** (Focus: release, not who released it)
- **Three bugs were found during testing.** (Focus: bugs, not testers)
- **The API will be deprecated next year.** (Focus: deprecation)

### 3. Formal/Technical Writing

Passive voice is common in technical documentation, scientific papers, and formal reports:

- **The experiment was conducted under controlled conditions.**
- **The following steps should be followed carefully.**
- **Python 3.9 is required for this application.**

### 4. Avoiding Blame

In professional contexts, passive voice can tactfully avoid assigning blame:

- **Mistakes were made in the deployment.** (vs. "You made mistakes...")
- **The deadline was missed.** (vs. "The team missed the deadline...")
- **Data was lost during the migration.** (Neutral tone)

## Common Passive Structures in IT

### Software Development

- "The code **is written** in TypeScript."
- "Unit tests **are performed** automatically."
- "The function **was refactored** for better performance."
- "Memory leaks **can be detected** using Chrome DevTools."

### System Administration

- "The servers **are maintained** by the operations team."
- "Backups **are created** daily at midnight."
- "The system **has been updated** to the latest version."
- "Logs **should be monitored** continuously."

### Security

- "Passwords **must be encrypted** before storage."
- "Access **is restricted** to authorized personnel only."
- "The vulnerability **was patched** immediately."
- "All requests **are authenticated** through OAuth."

### Documentation

- "Docker **is used** for containerization."
- "Kubernetes **is recommended** for orchestration."
- "The API **is documented** in the developer portal."
- "HTTPS **is required** for all connections."

## Passive with Modals

### Structure: Modal + be + past participle

- **must be**: "Dependencies **must be updated** regularly."
- **should be**: "Code **should be reviewed** before merging."
- **can be**: "The issue **can be resolved** quickly."
- **may be**: "The service **may be restarted** without notice."
- **will be**: "Features **will be released** next sprint."

## Advanced Passive Constructions

### Present Continuous Passive

**is/are being + past participle**

- "The application **is being tested** right now."
- "New features **are being developed** by the team."

### Past Continuous Passive

**was/were being + past participle**

- "The server **was being upgraded** when it crashed."
- "Logs **were being analyzed** during the incident."

### Present Perfect Passive

**has/have been + past participle**

- "The bug **has been fixed** in the latest release."
- "All data **has been migrated** successfully."

### Future Perfect Passive

**will have been + past participle**

- "The project **will have been completed** by December."
- "1000 users **will have been onboarded** by year-end."

## Active vs. Passive: Making the Right Choice

### Use Active When:

**More direct and engaging:**
- ✅ "We implemented the new feature." (Clear, direct)
- ✅ "The team fixed all critical bugs." (Shows responsibility)

### Use Passive When:

**Action matters more than actor:**
- ✅ "The new feature **was implemented** last week."
- ✅ "All critical bugs **have been fixed**."

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Incorrect

- The software **is need** to be updated. → **needs** (active) or **is needed** (passive)
- The code **has written** by John. → **was written**
- Data **are storing** in the cloud. → **is stored** or **are stored**

### ✅ Correct

- The software **needs** to be updated. (active)
- The software **is needed**. (passive)
- The code **was written** by John.
- Data **is stored** / **are stored** in the cloud.

## Technical Writing Examples

### Requirements Document

- "Python 3.9 or higher **is required**."
- "All dependencies **must be installed** before running the application."
- "Environment variables **should be configured** in the .env file."

### Incident Report

- "The outage **was caused** by a network failure."
- "Services **were restored** at 14:30 UTC."
- "The root cause **has been identified** and **will be addressed** in the next sprint."

### API Documentation

- "Authentication **is performed** using Bearer tokens."
- "Requests **are rate-limited** to 1000 per hour."
- "Responses **are returned** in JSON format."

## Practice

Convert these active sentences to passive voice:

1. The developers released the new version yesterday.
   → ________________

2. Machine learning models should analyze user behavior.
   → ________________

3. The team will deploy the application next week.
   → ________________

4. Security audits have found several vulnerabilities.
   → ________________

**Answers:**
1. The new version **was released** yesterday.
2. User behavior **should be analyzed** by machine learning models.
3. The application **will be deployed** next week.
4. Several vulnerabilities **have been found** (by security audits).

**Key Points:**
- Passive voice shifts focus from doer to action/result
- Common in technical, formal, and scientific writing
- Use when agent is unknown, unimportant, or obvious
- Avoid overuse - balance with active voice for clarity
- Essential for professional IT communication
